					<h2><span class="sub">Proof of Stake: A system run by the people</span></h2>
					
					<p>BlackCoin is based on a unique technology called Proof of Stake. Instead of verifying and securing the network with large calculations like other digital currencies, BlackCoin uses verification of the peoples' coins to secure the network and process transactions.</p>
					
					<p>The Proof of Stake system makes the BlackCoin operate much faster than nearly all other digital currencies. No more waiting on your money. Proof of Stake also ensures that BlackCoin remains decentralized; no one person or group can gain control of the network.</p>
					
					<p>BlackCoin holders receive 1% compounded yearly interest for their part in keeping the network secure through a process called <a href="#staking" class="modalbtn modal-trigger">staking</a>.</p>
